        "TheGrumman F-14 Tomcatis an American carrier-capablesupersonic,twin-engine, two-seat, twin-tail, all-weather-capablevariable-sweep wingfighter aircraft. The Tomcat was developed for theUnited States Navy's Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program after the collapse of theGeneral Dynamics-Grumman F-111Bproject. A large and well-equipped fighter, the F-14 was the first of the AmericanTeen Seriesfighters, which were designed incorporatingair combatexperience againstMiG fightersduring theVietnam War.",
        "Beginning in the late 1950s, the U.S. Navy sought a long-range, high-endurance interceptor to defend itscarrier battle groupsagainst long-rangeanti-ship missileslaunched from the jet bombers and submarines of theSoviet Union. They outlined the idea of a Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft with a more powerful radar and longer range missiles than theF-4 Phantom IIto intercept both enemy bombers and missiles at very long range.[4]Studies into this concept led to theDouglas F6D Missileerproject of 1959, but this large subsonic aircraft would have limited ability to evade supersonic fighters or defend itself once it fired its missiles, and the project was cancelled in December 1961.[5]",
        "Around this time, Vice Admiral Thomas F. Connolly, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare, flew the developmental F-111A variant on a flight and discovered that it had difficulty going supersonic and had poor carrier landing characteristics. He later testified before Congress about his concerns against the official Navy position and, in May 1968, Congress stopped funding for the F-111B, allowing the Navy to pursue an answer tailored to its requirements.[11]",
        "McDonnell Douglas and Grumman were selected as finalists in December 1968. Grumman's 303E design was selected for the contract award in January 1969.[15]The design reused theTF30engines from the F-111B, though the Navy planned on replacing them with thePratt & Whitney F401-400engines under development for the Navy, along with the relatedPratt & Whitney F100for the USAF.[16]Though lighter than the F-111B, it was still the largest and heaviest U.S. fighter to fly from an aircraft carrier, a consequence of the requirement to carry the largeAWG-9 radarand AIM-54 Phoenix missiles (from the F-111B) and an internal fuel load of 16,000 lb (7,300 kg). The design service life was 6,000 flight hours, although this was later extended to 7,200 hours.[17]",
        "TheTactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System(TARPS) was developed in the late 1970s for the F-14. Approximately 65 F-14As and all F-14Ds were modified to carry the pod.[24]TARPS was primarily controlled by the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) via an extra display for observing reconnaissance data. The \"TARPS Digital (TARPS-DI)\" was a 1996 upgrade featuring a digital camera. The digital camera was further updated beginning in 1998 with the \"TARPS Completely Digital (TARPS-CD)\" configuration that also provided real-time transmission of imagery.[25]",
        "In the 1990s, with the pending retirement of theGrumman A-6 Intruderand the cancellation of theMcDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger IIAdvanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA), the F-14air-to-groundprogram was resurrected. Trials with live bombs had been carried out in the 1980s; the F-14 was cleared to use basiciron bombsin 1992. During Operation Desert Storm of theGulf War, most air-to-ground missions were left toLTV A-7 Corsair II, A-6 Intruder and F/A-18 Hornet squadrons, while the F-14s focused on air defense operations. Following Desert Storm, F-14As and F-14Bs underwent upgrades to avionics and cockpit displays to enable the use of precision munitions, enhance defensive systems, and apply structural improvements. The new avionics were comparable with the F-14D; these upgraded aircraft were designated F-14A (Upgrade) and F-14B (Upgrade) respectively.[24]",
        "By 1994, Grumman and the Navy were proposing ambitious plans for Tomcat upgrades beyond the D model to plug the gap between the retirement of the A-6 and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet entering service (such as the Super Tomcat 21, the cheaper QuickStrike version, and the more advanced Attack Super Tomcat 21).[31]However, the upgrades would have taken too long to implement to meet the gap, and were priced in the billions. TheU.S. Congressconsidered this too expensive for an interim solution.[24]A quick, inexpensive upgrade using theLow Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night(LANTIRN) targeting pod was devised. The LANTIRN pod provided the F-14 with a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera for night operations and a laser target designator to direct laser-guided bombs (LGB).[32]Although LANTIRN is traditionally a two-pod system, an AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod with terrain-following radar and a wide-angle FLIR, along with an AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod with a steerable FLIR and a laser target designator, the decision was made to only use the targeting pod. The Tomcat's LANTIRN pod was altered and improved over the baseline configuration, such as aGlobal Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System(GPS/INS) capability to allow an F-14 to accurately locate itself. The pod was carried on the right wing glove pylon.[32]",
        "The LANTIRN pod did not require changes to the F-14's own system software, but the pod was designed to operate on a MIL-STD-1553B bus not present on the F-14A or B.  Consequently,Martin Mariettaspecially developed an interface card for LANTIRN. The Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) would receive pod imagery on a 10-inch Programmable Tactical Information Display (PTID) or another Multi-Function Display in the F-14[citation needed]rear cockpit and guided LGBs using a new hand controller installed on the right side console. Initially, the hand controller replaced the RIO's TARPS control panel, meaning a Tomcat configured for LANTIRN could not carry TARPS and the reverse, but eventually a workaround was later developed to allow a Tomcat to carry LANTIRN or TARPS as needed.[32]",
        "An upgraded LANTIRN named \"LANTIRN 40K\" for operations up to 40,000 ft (12,000 m) was introduced in 2001, followed by Tomcat Tactical Targeting (T3) and Fast Tactical Imagery (FTI), to provide precise target coordinate determination and ability to transmit images in-flight.[1]Tomcats also added the ability to carry theGBU-38Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) in 2003, giving it the option of a variety of LGB andGPS-guided weapons.[33]Some F-14Ds were upgraded in 2005 with aROVER IIIFull Motion Video (FMV) downlink, a system that transmits real-time images from the aircraft's sensors to the laptop of aforward air controller(FAC) on the ground.[34]",
        "In the early 1980s, the Navy anticipated that an Advanced Carrier-Borne Multirole Fighter (VFMX) would eventually be the long term high-end replacement for the F-14 and A-6, although this program was short-lived and was succeeded by separate efforts for fleet air defense and deep strike/attack; the latter would become the ATA program under which the A-12 Avenger II was being developed. In 1988, the service announced that it would procure a derivative of the Air Force'sAdvanced Tactical Fighter(ATF), named the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) that would eventually have been anavalised variant of the F-22, as the long term F-14 replacement.[35]However, the collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in declining defense budgets and also in a steep increase in the unit cost of the ATF and NATF due to reduced production rates. With tightening budgets, the Navy chose to focus on its top aviation priority, the A-12, and canceled the NATF in 1991, believing that the F-14D would be viable for fleet air defense until 2015. However, the cancellation of the A-12 shortly afterwards due to cost overruns and technical problems resulted in the Navy launching a new attack aircraft program, the Advanced-Attack (A-X), while the F-14 with LANTIRN and ground attack upgrades would provide some interim capabilities, with Grumman proposing even more F-14 upgrades in the 1990s.[36]",
        "The F-14's fuselage and wings allow it to climb faster than the F-4, while the \"twin-tail\"empennage(dual vertical stabilizers with ventral fins on the engine nacelles) offers better stability. The F-14 is equipped with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcanrotary cannonmounted on the left side (unlike the Phantom, which was not equipped with an internal gun in the US Navy), and can carry AIM-54 Phoenix, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-9 Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles. The twin engines are housed in widely spacednacelles. The flat area of the fuselage between the nacelles is used to contain fuel and avionics systems, such as the wing-sweep mechanism and flight controls, as well as weaponry since the wings are not used for carrying ordnance.[45]By itself, thefuselageprovides approximately 40 to 60 percent of the F-14's aerodynamic lifting surface depending on the wing sweep position.[citation needed]Thelifting bodycharacteristics of the fuselage allowed one F-14 to safely land after suffering amid-air collisionthat sheared off more than half of the plane's right wing in 1991.[46]",
        "The landing gear is very robust, in order to withstandcatapult launches (takeoffs) and recoveries (landings)needed for carrier operations. It comprises a double nosewheel and widely spaced single main wheels. There are no hardpoints on the sweeping parts of the wings, and so all thearmamentis fitted on the belly between the airintake rampsand on pylons under the wing gloves. Internal fuel capacity is 2,400 US gal (9,100 L): 290 US gal (1,100 L) in each wing, 690 US gal (2,600 L) in a series of tanks aft of the cockpit, and a further 457 US gal (1,730 L) in two feeder tanks. It can carry two 267 US gal (1,010 L) externaldrop tanksunder the engine intake ramps.[45]There is also an air-to-air refueling probe, which folds into the starboard nose.[citation needed]",
        "The F-14's wing sweep can be varied between 20° and 68° in flight,[47]and can be automatically controlled by itsCentral Air Data Computer(CADC), which maintains wing sweep at the optimumlift-to-drag ratioas theMach numbervaries; pilots can manually override the system if desired.[45]When parked, the wings can be \"overswept\" to 75° to overlap the horizontal stabilizers to save deck space aboard carriers. In an emergency, the F-14 can land with the wings fully swept to 68°,[45]although this presents a significant safety hazard due to greatly increased stall speed. Such an aircraft would typically be diverted from an aircraft carrier to a land base if an incident did occur. The F-14 has flown safely with an asymmetrical wing-sweep during testing, and was deemed able to land aboard a carrier if needed in an emergency.[48]",
        "The wing pivot points are significantly spaced far apart. This has two benefits. The first is that weaponry can be fitted on a pylon on the fixed wing glove, liberating the wings from having swiveling pylons fitted, a feature which had proven to add significant drag on the F-111B.[44]Since less of the total lifting area is variable, the center of lift moves less as the wings move, reducing trim drag at high speed.[44]When the wing is swept back, itsthickness-to-chord ratiodecreases, which allows the aircraft to satisfy the Mach 2.4 top speed required by the U.S. Navy.[44]The body of the aircraft contributes significantly to overall lift and so the Tomcat possesses a lower wing loading than its wing area would suggest. When carrying four Phoenix missiles or other heavy stores between the engines this advantage is lost and maneuverability is reduced in those configurations.[44]",
        "Aileronsare not fitted, withroll controlbeing provided by wing-mountedspoilersat low speed (which are disabled if the sweep angle exceeds 57°), and by differential operation of the all-movingtaileronsat high speed.[45]Full-spanslatsandflapsare used to increase lift both for landing and combat, with slats being set at 17° for landing and 7° for combat, while flaps are set at 35° for landing and 10° for combat.[45]An air bag fills up the space occupied by the swept-back wing when the wing is in the forward position and a flexible fairing on top of the wing smooths out the shape transition between the fuselage and top wing area.[44]The twin tail layout helps in maneuvers at high angle of attack (AoA) while reducing the height of the aircraft to fit within the limited roof clearance ofhangarsaboardaircraft carriers.[45]",
        "The upgraded F-14A+, later redesignated F-14B, and F-14D were equipped with the General Electric F110-GE-400. The F110 provided a significant increase in thrust, with a static uninstalled thrust of 26,950 pounds-force (120 kN); installed thrust is 23,400 pounds-force (104 kN) with afterburner at sea level, which rose to 30,200 lbf (134 kN) at Mach 0.9.[53][54]The increased thrust gave the Tomcat a better than 1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio at low fuel quantities, and the rate of climb was increased by 61%. The basic engine thrust without afterburner was powerful enough for carrier launches. While this did result in fuel savings, the main reason not to use afterburner during carrier launches was that if an engine failed the F110's thrust in full afterburner would produce a yawing moment too abruptly for the pilot to correct. Thus the launch of an F-14B or F-14D with afterburner was rare, while the F-14A required full afterburner unless very lightly loaded. The F110 was also more efficient, allowing the Tomcat to cruise comfortably above 30,000 ft (9,100 m), which increased its range and survivability as well as endurance for time on station. In the overland attack role, this gave the F-14B and F-14D 60% more striking range or one-third more time on station.[55]The F-14B arrived in time to participate in Desert Storm.[citation needed]",
        "The F-14 was designed to combat highly maneuverable aircraft as well as the Soviet anti-ship cruise missile andbomber(Tupolev Tu-16,Tupolev Tu-22,Tupolev Tu-22M) threats.[43]The Tomcat was to be a platform for the AIM-54 Phoenix, but unlike the canceled F-111B, it could also engage medium- and short-range threats with other weapons.[41][43]The F-14 is anair superiority fighter, not just a long-range interceptor aircraft.[43]Over 6,700 kg (14,800 lb) of stores can be carried for combat missions on severalhardpointsunder the fuselage and under the wing gloves. Commonly, this means a maximum of four Phoenixes or Sparrows on the belly stations, two Phoenixes/Sparrows on the wing hardpoints, and two Sidewinders on the wing glove hardpoints.[citation needed]The F-14 is also fitted with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. The Tomcat could also support MK-80 - MK-84 GBUs on its hardpoints. While in this configuration it was known to pilots as a \"Bombcat\".[citation needed]",
        "Operationally, the capability to hold up to six Phoenix missiles was never used, although early testing was conducted; there was never a threat requirement to engage six hostile targets simultaneously and the load was too heavy to safely recover aboard an aircraft carrier in the event that the missiles were not fired. During the height of Cold War operations in the late 1970s and 1980s, the typical weapon loadout on carrier-deployed F-14s was usually two AIM-54 Phoenixes, augmented by two AIM-9 Sidewinders, three AIM-7 Sparrows, a full loadout of20 mmammunition and two drop tanks.[citation needed]The Phoenix missile was used twice in combat by the U.S. Navy, both over Iraq in 1999,[65][66][67]but the missiles did not score any kills.[citation needed]According to retired RIO Dave Baranek, the first two launch failures, on January 5, 1999, occurred when two F-14D Super Tomcats, carrying AIM-54Cs, fired two Phoenix missiles at a pair of MiG-23 jets.  The missiles' rocket motors did not ignite because they were improperly armed prior to launch from the carrier.[68][69]However, as two F/A-18s chased the two MiG-23s, one MiG-23 ran out of fuel and crashed, killing the pilot.  The US Navy did not claim a kill, but Captain James T. Knight, commander of CVW-11, said \"Screw him...a kill is a kill.\"[70]On 14 September 1999, an F-14D assigned to CVW-2 aboard the USS Constellation fired an AIM-54C missile at a MiG-23 at very long range.  The MiG-23 quickly turned and fled, and was able to outrun the missile.  Lieutenant Commander Coby \"Coach\" Loessberg, the Super Tomcat's pilot, commented afterward that had the Tomcat been closer to the center of the envelope, at optimal speed and altitude, a kill would have been more likely.[71]",
        "Following the US Navy's retirement of its Tomcats in 2006, Iran sought to purchase spare parts for its aircraft.[111]In January 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that sales of spare F-14 parts would be suspended over concerns of the parts ending up in Iran.[112]In July 2007, the remaining American F-14s were shredded to ensure that any parts could not be acquired.[90]Despite these measures, Iran managed to significantly increase its stocks of spare parts, increasing the number of airworthy Tomcats, although as it did not manage to obtain spare parts for the aircraft's weapon systems, the number of combat ready Tomcats was still low (seven in 2008).[113]In 2010, Iran requested that the U.S. deliver the 80th F-14 that it had purchased in 1974 but never received due to the Islamic Revolution.[114][115]In October 2010, an Iranian Air Force commander claimed that the country overhauls and optimizes different types of military aircraft, mentioning their Air Force has installed Iran-made radar systems on the F-14.[116]In 2012, the Iranian Air Force's Mehrabad Overhaul Center delivered an F-14 with upgraded weapon systems with locally sourced components, designated F-14AM.[117]Shortages of Phoenix missiles led to attempts to integrate the RussianR-27 semi-active radar-guided missile, but these proved unsuccessful. An alternative was the use of modifiedMIM-23 Hawkmissiles to replace the Tomcat's Phoenixes and Sparrows, but as the Tomcat could only carry two Hawks, this project was also abandoned, and theFakour-90missile, which used the guidance system of the Hawk packaged into the airframe of the Phoenix, launched. Pre-production Fakour-90s were delivered in 2017, and a production order for 100 missiles (now designated AIM-23B) was placed in 2018, intending to replace the F-14s AIM-7E Sparrow missiles.[118]"
